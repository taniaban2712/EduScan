## Objective: ##
Manual attendance tracking is time-consuming for teachers in educational institutions. It can result in errors and discrepancies in attendance records.Transcribing attendance data from paper records to a computerized system can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, especially in large educational institutions with numerous classes and students. This system aims to overcome these challenges by simplifying attendance management.  
## Features: ##
* Marking attendance based on facial recognition
* Generate reports of the studentâ€™s attendance in different lectures
* Sending monthly e-mails to the student if their attendance is below 75%
* A dedicated frontend for students, allowing them to view their own attendance records and receive notifications
* A leaderboard based on attendance
* A discussion panel where students and teachers can engage in discussions on educational topics.

## TechStack: ##
* Python
* Dash
* OpenCV
* HTML, CSS
* Javascript
* React.js
* Postgresql

## Future Scope: ##
* Developing a comprehensive dashboard for teachers and administrators with more detailed statistics and visualizations like graphs and charts
* Implement class duration tracking to provide insights into how much time each student spends in class
* A quizzing module within the app to allow teachers to create, administer, and grade quizzes, tests, and assessments digitally
